<h4><strong>Global Canberran Programme 2024: A Journey of Learning and Service in Cambodia</strong></h4>
<p>This past May, our Secondary 3 Canberrans embarked on an unforgettable
journey to Siem Reap, Cambodia, as part of the Global Canberran Programme
(GCP). This marks our first international trip since the onset of the COVID-19
pandemic, making it an especially significant experience for our students.</p>
<h4><strong>Service Learning at Prolit Primary School</strong></h4>
<p>Divided into five dynamic groups, our Canberrans enthusiastically engaged
in a service learning project at Prolit Primary School. They organized
and participated in a variety of enriching activities:</p>

<h4><strong>Cultural Immersion and Sustainability</strong></h4>
<p>Beyond their service work, our Canberrans had the opportunity to engage
in hands-on learning experiences that highlighted local culture and sustainability.
Our Canberrans explored the intricate process of crafting scent candles,
gaining insights into sustainable practices. They also learned traditional
Cambodian craftsmanship by weaving palm leaves into beautiful boxes, connecting
with the rich cultural heritage of the region.</p>

education, creativity, physical activity, and community service. It was
inspiring to witness our students build meaningful connections and make

global awareness and a spirit of service that will stay with them long
after their return home.</p>
