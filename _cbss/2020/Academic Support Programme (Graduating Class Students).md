<p>Canberra Secondary School will be having face-to-face academic support programme to prepare our graduating class students for their National Examination from Monday 20 July 2020 to Wednesday 22 July 2020.<br /><br />The school has taken the following safety measures to ensure the well-being of staff and students. We seek the cooperation of students returning to comply with the following measures:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Report on time according to schedule and to leave immediately for home after their lessons.</li>
<li>Daily temperature checks will be done for students to screen out those who are unwell. Students who are unwell will not be allowed to join the classes.</li>
<li>Students on LOA/HQO/SHN or staying with household members on HQO/SHN/medical leave with flu-like symptoms are not allowed back to school during this period.</li>
<li>Students are to stick to their fixed classes/teaching groups, with no intermingling across groups.</li>
<li>Venues have been arranged to allow safe distancing between students. Students are to ensure social distancing at all times in class and outside class in the school premises.</li>
<li>Students are to wear their own masks at all times in school.</li>
<li>Students to practice good personal hygiene and continue wipe-down routine after use of the venue.</li>
</ol>
<p>We look forward to supporting our students but seek the help of all to keep our students and staff safe during this period.</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>
