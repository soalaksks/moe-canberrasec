<p>As part of our academic and character development, we have the Global Canberran Programme (GCP) for our students to facilitate this internationalisation process. The GCP educational travel has enabled our students to learn beyond classroom walls. Students who participate in educational travel benefit from exposure to new people, experiences, and cultures. Along with a better understanding of subject material, the GCP educational travel has also provided opportunities for students to grow in self-confidence and independence.</p>

<p>The following reflections by our students attest to the benefits and results of the GCP:</p>
<p>I learnt that showing leadership is not easy in a group of different people but if we cooperate and do everything as a team, every tough challenge will become easy.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the 6-day trip and I felt that it was very meaningful. I know more about Korea's culture and history. I think that Koreans are all very polite. When we visited the Dongguk Girls' Middle school, I realised that all the students there respect their teachers very much. When they walked past their teachers, they would bow and greet them. In Singapore, we only greet teachers in the classroom. During the lesson that we observed, the students sat down quietly and listened to the teacher. They paid close attention to the teacher.</p>

<p>In Singapore, the places are clean but people are quite rude. In Taiwan, the places and buildings are cluttered together yet the people are kind and warm. There are three good aspects that I have learned in Taiwan: <br />1. When people are crossing the road, the drivers would not honk at us but simply patiently wait for us to cross the road.&nbsp;<br />2. There are no rubbish bins in every place. Nonetheless, I was shocked that there was no rubbish in the middle of the road or path. Taiwanese have a strong pride for cleanliness.&nbsp;<br />3. The people would give way to the people who walked first. They would simply wait for the people to pass through first&nbsp;.<br /><br /><strong>Cultural Immersion to Taiwan, Natalie Woo, 2E1 </strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="sigProPrintMessage">We gained more knowledge from the trip. We did community work at an orphanage during our homestay. We also gained new experience while staying in a kampong house at the village and did activities that we hardly do in Singapore like gardening. Even though we are also Malays, the villagers have a different accent and sometimes it was difficult for us to understand what they were trying to say. The villagers were friendly. We also learnt a lot about Langkawi's history through stories such as the Legend of Mahsuri. We also learnt how to do batik painting and plant paddy. In conclusion, the trip was fun and enjoyable as we gained more knowledge throughout the trip&nbsp;.<br /><br /><strong>Malay Lang Dept Cultural Enrichment to Langkawi, Nur Haifah Edris, 3N1 </strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The training was quite tiring for me. I realised that some of my peers are stronger than me, so I must train harder. I made friends during the training sessions and friendly matches. I have improved my badminton skill, but I need more practice. I gained experience from friendly games. After the trip, I know Singapore is really small, but I love my country very much.</p>

<p>31st May till 4th June 2010 was one of the most memorable trips in my secondary life. It has been a challenging climb up to the peak of Mount Kinabalu but the view from the top was breath-taking and all the exhaustion paid off. Climbing down was fun, especially when your teachers and friends were right beside you, keeping your spirits up and having fun with you. Along the way, I' learnt many interesting things about nature and life. The climb may be challenging at first but, when you reach the peak of the mountain, the tiredness went away. In life there are ups and downs. You must always believe that when you are having a problem, happiness is waiting for you at the end of the road. Not to forget, team work is crucial. In a team, Together Everyone Achieves More. Even though not everyone in the group reached the peak, I am sure all of us had tried our best. I also believe that everyone in the team had a great experience just like I did .</p>
