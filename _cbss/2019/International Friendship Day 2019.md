<p>In an effort to show appreciation to our international friends (migrant workers) for their contributions to Singapore, the school collaborated with Northoaks Primary School to contribute apples to treat the migrants who work in the Sembawang Community. To deepen the students&rsquo; understanding and appreciation towards our migrant workers, representative from Migrant Workers Centre also shared with our students on their contributions and challenges faced by migrant workers, expats and new citizens. Through these activities, our students learnt to appreciate these unsung heroes and we are hopeful that our students will demonstrate our school values of gratitude and respectful towards these migrant workers.</p>
