<p>Our school commemorated Total Defence Day on 15 February 2019. In line with this year&rsquo;s theme, &ldquo;Together We Keep Singapore Strong&rdquo;, there were a series of activities planned to remind students of the importance of Total Defence and to be grateful to Singapore&rsquo;s continued security by putting Total Defence into action through simulating war times period.</p>

<p>Our students experienced a morning without lights and fans in the&nbsp;classroom, followed by an emergency evacuation drill and the rationing of sweet potato porridge during their recess to remind them to be grateful for what we have today and not take the security and successes of Singapore for granted. To show gratitude to the people who have contributed to Singapore&rsquo;s security, survival and success, the students are encouraged to pen down appreciation messages to someone in their family/friend/teacher/someone they know who contributes to the 5 aspects of total defence. Lastly, speakers representing different sectors such as healthcare, navy, Land Transport Authority (LTA) shared with our students on the rationale behind Total Defence and how Total Defence is the cornerstone of Singapore&rsquo;s deterrent strategy.</p>
