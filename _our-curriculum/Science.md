<p>Science is the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment. In Canberra, the Science Curriculum is designed in alignment to the Singapore Science Curriculum Framework to</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Engage students in the learning of science through the use of inquiry-based pedagogy to nurture Critical Thinkers &amp; Inquisitive Explorers. Learning Experiences are designed for students to sharpen critical thinking skills and to inspire them to inquisitively explore the scientific concepts beyond the textbook to further enrich their learning of science and add joy to their learning experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support students’ learning through Inquiry approach in alignment to the School’s Values of Gratitude, Respect and Compassion. Learning Experiences are designed for students to acquire the science knowledge with gratitude and respect and apply them with compassion to real world situations, with the purpose of making the world a better place for all mankind.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>The department works together collaboratively to conduct meaningful instructional and enrichment programmes to ignite their passion and interest for the love of Science. This is achieved by consciously planning and giving students more opportunities to learn through a variety of hands-on activities and projects. A research module was also incorporated into the Sec 1 curriculum to allow students to solve problems using scientific methods and to nurture innovation and collaborative thinking skills in their learning of scientific concepts.</p>
<p>The use of ICT to capture the learning processes in Science was implemented for Sec 1 Science. With the upcoming PDLP (Personalized Digital Learning Programme) being implemented in 2021, students will be exposed to various ICT platforms and apps to enrich and deepen their scientific learning. Using the Google Classroom platform, the department aims to encourage students to actively collect and reflect on their own learning experiences. The students have the opportunities to use digital photography and videography to capture their own experiments and to write about their learning on for the teacher to give formative feedback for further improvements. They are also given opportunities to use computers and mobile phones to search the internet and organise their own learning materials on top of the notes given to them. This is particularly interesting when students actively search for relevant YouTube videos and online materials to complement their own learning. Through the use of ICT, students have gained a greater ownership in their learning and they are more engaged when they have the choice to present their learning beyond the traditional pen and paper methods.</p>
<p>Apart from the structured instructional programme, the department have a talent development programme where students are exposed to national science competitions, seminars and workshops to widen their horizon of learning of science.</p>
<p>Over the past years, our students have participated in various science competitions and workshops in Singapore and gained rich learning experiences. A summary of our students’ participation &amp; achievements in competitions.</p>

<p>In 2020, due to the COVID-19 situation, the competition had gone virtual this year, and the participants had to submit a video for judging. Seven teams represented our school for the audition round and three teams emerged as finalists. These three teams had worked tirelessly to create their videos and had a great time showcasing their learning. The enthusiasm and creativity they had demonstrated in their entries impressed the judges and they were selected from among 18 finalists in the secondary school category.</p>
<p>One team of our students were also featured in Lianhe Zaobao student segment: zbCOMMA are our Lower Secondary students, Joash, Jayden and Jun Wei, whose interesting competition entry caught the eye of the media.</p>
<p>In the article, the students shared about their experiences of the Science Buskers Festival as well as the Masterclass Workshop hosted by Science Made Simple’s David Price via Zoom.

<p><strong>Singapore Young Physicist Tournament<br></strong>The pinnacle of physics competition in secondary school is the Singapore Young Physicist Tournament. The student participants are required to investigate complex, real world problems through independent research. A Team of three students from class 4E2 spent time doing literature reviews, conducting experiments and simulations, before presenting their finding in front of expert judges and defend their presentation. They did the school proud by qualifying for the finals held on 2 Feb 2020. The team received a commendation award for their performance in the competition.</p>

<p><strong>Singapore Junior Physics Olympiad<br></strong>For upper secondary students looking for a challenge, some of them participated in Singapore Junior Physics Olympiad. The competition tested topics beyond the syllabus, and required the students to engage their physics, mathematics and logic capabilities to solve authentic problems. In 2019, Joon Hin from class 4E2 managed to enter the finals, and secured a Bronze award; while many other was accorded special mention.</p>
