<p>Here at Canberra, every Canberran serve as an active participant to be given the opportunity to learn about music through different avenues. We are passionate about empowering youth to develop and also foster GRC value in action through music making and music performances. Students are trained through a learning chain: from &ldquo;Exposure&rdquo;, to &ldquo;Experience&rdquo; the different music, and finally &ldquo;Express&rdquo; themselves in school wide performance platforms. The enriching experiences enable students to express their music flair and talents during lessons curriculums, ICT collaborative learning experience via SLS as well as Virtual online performances at our quarterly LTCH &ldquo;Lunch Time Canberra Hour&rdquo;. This performance platform allow Canberrans to express their extraordinary musical and artistic talents. We also took the opportunity to display GRC (Gracious, Respects and Compassion) of fellow Canberrans through these music performances.</p>
