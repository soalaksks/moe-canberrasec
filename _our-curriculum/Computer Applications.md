<p>The CPA unit aims to develop our students to acquire in-depth knowledge and understanding of computing concepts, enhance their proficiency in using a range of application software, strengthen their computational thinking and problem solving skills and educate them on the safe use of technology in everyday life.</p>
<p>Students are taught a repertoire of IT skills and tools that present a natural fit into Baseline ICT Skill areas of word processing, spreadsheet, multimedia, animation and game-making.</p>
<p>Different pedagogical approaches are used by teachers including designing lessons in the Student Learning Space (SLS) that makes students&rsquo; thinking visible and facilitate teachers in assessing students&rsquo; understanding. Students are constantly encouraged to be creative and exploratory when engaging in both self-directed and collaborative learning activities.</p>
<p>Coursework projects are conducted to enhance the students learning and hands-on skills, which require students to apply skills from different application software. To recognize the effort put in by the students, outstanding work pieces are selected to participate in the annual Media Computing competition organized by MOE CPDD.</p>
<p>As part of the efforts to promote the inculcation of values in the students, lessons are designed for each Secondary level with different tasks that require students to think deeply about gratitude, respect and compassion through reflections. When students go through these authentic tasks, they also reinforce their conceptual understandings of key knowledge and skills required for the subject by applying what they have been taught.</p>
