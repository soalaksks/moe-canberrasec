<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Every child a self-directed problem solver with
a passion for Mathematics.</p>

<h4><strong>About The Department:</strong></h4>
<p><em>“We can calculate but we are not calculative!”</em>
</p>
<p>This encapsulates our department's belief and culture of gratitude and
mutual respect. We view teachers as our most invaluable resource and continuously
strive to improve ourselves for the benefit of our students. We foster
a culture of sharing and support, understanding the importance of helping
one another. It's commonly accepted that students can seek help from any
Mathematics teacher in the school, not just their own. We are committed
to providing guidance and support, always prioritizing the needs of our
students.</p>
<h4><strong>Our Programmes:</strong></h4>
<p>Some of our successful past programmes include Mathematics Trails, Escape
Room challenges, performance tasks, maths video presentations, the Maths
Excellence Programme, and e-learning initiatives. The department is now
working on exploring the infusion of computational thinking in the mathematics
classroom.</p>
