**Canberra Secondary School welcomes our 2023 Sec 1 Students and Parents!**

Congratulations on your posting to Canberra Secondary to commence your secondary school education.
It will be a new phase of your development and we are happy to welcome you to the Canberran family!
When you receive your posting to Canberra, you **do not need** to physically report to our school the next
day as we will be conducting our Sec 1 Registration Exercise online.

**1. Sec 1 Online Registration<br>
Please ensure that you have your Parents Gateway app to complete the Sec 1 Online Registration. <br>

You and your child must report to the General Office at the assigned timing (refer to Table 1) for administrative purposes before going to the bookshop to collect the books and uniforms. You may contact the General Office at 6758 5070 if you do not receive the Parents Gateway

**4. Appeal for transfer for serious medical conditions**<br>
If you assess that Canberra Secondary School is unable to accommodate your child’s physical health or
special learning needs, you may appeal for a transfer. Appeals can be filed at Canberra Secondary
School General Office **on the next day after the posting results have been released.**

**Points to note about appealing for a transfer:**
* Appeals will only be considered on an exceptional basis for students with:
<ol>1. Serious medical conditions, such as chronic heart conditions or kidney problems. <br>
	2. Severe physical impairments, such as those requiring permanent use of a wheelchair. </ol>
* All appeals must be accompanied by relevant supporting documents, such as medical reports and
letters from doctors.
* Our staff at the General Office will help to file your appeal. The appeal results will be released in early January.
* If you intend to appeal for transfer, your child must still report to our school on the **reporting day.**
* Your child is to continue to attend school until his/her appeal for transfer is approved.
* Transfers are subjected to vacancies at the requested transfer school.

**Note:**
If you are seeking a transfer due to other reasons, you **may** approach the school of your choice directly.
It’s important to keep the following in mind:
* Your child’s Achievement Level score should meet the school’s cut-off score of the posting year.
* Your child should meet the school’s admission criteria.
* The school must have available vacancies.


**5. Sec 1 Orientation Programme 2023**<br>
Details for Sec 1 Orientation Programme will be made available through Parents Gateway and the School Website.

**6. Transition to secondary school**<br>
Students moving from primary to secondary school are entering a new phase of life. Learn about common
challenges and how to help your child with the transition.

**Help your child to understand the common challenges**<br>
Some of the challenges faced by students entering secondary school include:
* New school environment
* New friends
* New syllabus
* New phase of life

Your child has spent the last 6 years getting used to their primary school, and now they’ll be going to a
new school. Moreover, many of your child’s primary school friends may be posted to different secondary
schools.

Meeting new people can be difficult, but it’s also an opportunity for them to form new, long-lasting
friendships.

Your child will also be learning new subjects, including biology, chemistry, physics, geography and history.
There will also be more subject choices, especially in upper secondary.

In this phase of school, your child will enter their teenage years and go through physical, emotional and
mental changes. They will also begin to explore the different pathways available for them to fulfil their
dreams and aspirations.

**Support your child’s development and interests**<br>
It’s important that you pick a school where your child’s development and interests will be supported.
Generally, secondary school students do best when they:
* Feel a sense of belonging, with their friends and at the school.
* Feel a sense of purpose and progress.
* Get the opportunity to contribute to the school, for example through their Co-Curricular Activities
(CCAs).
* Find their interests and learn new things.
* Have teachers who care about them and cater to their needs.
* Are able to enjoy the process of learning at an appropriate level for them.


**Encourage your child to prepare for the transition**<br>
When discussing these challenges with your child, encourage them to:
* Choose subjects and electives that interest them.
* Look beyond academics and pursue activities that excite them.
* Make new friends and involve themselves in sports, games, clubs and other CCAs. They get the opportunity to find their interests and learn new things.
* Let you know if they are having difficulties in school.


**Join the Parent Support Group (PSG)**<br>
We welcome you to join our Parent Support Group (PSG) which aims to promote partnership between
the parents and the school towards the holistic development of every student. We encourage you to volunteer your precious time in any of the school’s activities. Your support will make a big difference to the school and your child.

To join the PSG, kindly submit the form below to General Office or through your child. Should you require
more details or clarification, please email us at [canberra_ss@moe.edu.sg](mailto:canberra_ss@moe.edu.sg).
