<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>Canberra Secondary School ALP on Visual Arts, Design and Media (VADM)
is repositioned from our past strength in Digital Media. It is aligned
to 21st Century Competencies Framework and to realise the vision of Every
Canberran a Self-Directed Learner. We see VADM as a form of Aesthetics
that helps our students to strike a balance between technical skills mastery
with appreciation for the arts thus helping them in their holistic development.
Our ALP incorporates learning in authentic setting, increased focus, alignment
and integration as well as experiences and exposure to career prospects
in VADM. The exposure in depth and breadth gives our students the opportunity
to identify their aptitudes and interests, build their strengths, and make
informed decisions on their education and career choices.</p>
<p>ALP is the Integration of Art curriculum and ICT curriculum which is inclusive
of 2 tiers - Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 2 plus.</p>
<p>The 1st Tier is acquisition of knowledge and its pervasive learning through
all level. The secondary 1 Visual Art curriculum looks into preparing students
with visual aesthetics and digital media skills.</p>
<p>The secondary 2 Visual Art curriculum looks into equipping students with
visual aesthetics and digital media skills. Besides having all sec 1 and
2 students undergo ALP curriculum, we also have our sec 3, 4 &amp; 5 Artist-students
(students who select Art as an elective in upper sec) coming on board in
this programme. This group of upper sec students will use the knowledge
that they had learnt in lower sec and apply in their Art curriculum.</p>
<p>In Tier 2, students will be considered as specialist and will focus on
the application of skills. This group of students will be identified from
sec 1, those who have been scoring well for both Art and ICT curriculum
will be offered to join&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>igital&nbsp;<strong>M</strong>edia
in Visual&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>rts (DMA) club. They will therefore undergo
deeper engagement in digital media through visual art.</p>
<p>For tier 2 plus, we call it Mastery because this group of students from
DMA club will initiate personal project that is related to what they had
learnt.</p>

<h3><strong>Digital Media in Visual Arts (DMA) Club</strong></h3>
<p>The Digital Media in Visual Arts Club serves as an avenue for students
to pursue their interest in digital media such as photography and videography
as a CCA.</p>
<p>In Canberra Secondary school, we organise Photography competition once
a year and this is open to other schools which is known as “National Young
Shutterbug”. The objective of this event is to impart Digital Media skills
to all primary schools (Cluster/National) in the area of digital photography.
It is also to promote National Education values through cultural sites
explorations and appreciation of the uniqueness in racial harmony within
a multi-cultural society. Lastly we also want to promote Self-Directed
learning and Collaborative Learning.</p>
<p>Students from DMA club will apply their skills to guide the participants
to understand the inter-relationships between different disciplines of
digital media design, to develop social cohesiveness and awareness on the
importance of racial harmony and gaining knowledge in the rich cultural
heritage that Singapore possessed. It will also help to develop self-directed
and collaborative learning through setting of goals and finding the right
tools and strategies to achieve them.</p>
<p>The programme benefited students because this experience will level-up
their skills and competency in digital media design through better understanding
of equipment controls, techniques with timely feedback by trainers. It
also help students to apply the relevant skills and competency acquired
immediately into practice in their role as student-trainers for each group.</p>
<p>Through DMA club, talented students will be further developed in their
knowledge of digital media productions and will be sent for participations
in the various competitions such as the Singapore Digital Media Awards
(SDMA). This is aligned to specialist track under the tier two programme.</p>
