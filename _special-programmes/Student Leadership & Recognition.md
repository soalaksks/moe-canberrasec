<p><strong>STUDENT LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>We, in Canberra Secondary School believe that it is vital to nurture students as growing leaders for their holistic development. The Student Leadership Committee aims to offer platforms for students across the levels to develop their leadership skills and potential progressively.</p>
<p>The student leadership development structure (Annex 1B) and framework are erected, based on the strong foundations of shared leadership where everyone pitches in their efforts to make a project possible and servant leadership where students serve, lead and excel. The student leadership development structure and framework also centre about the school core values, vision and mission statement to nurture the leadership potential of students.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To look into the development of leadership potential in our students. The opportunities for leadership exposure will be:</li>
<ul>
<li>Student Council Executive Committee</li>
<li>Peer Support Leaders</li>
<li>Classroom Leaders</li>
<li>CCA Leaders</li>
<li>Peer Support Leader Intern</li>
</ul>
<li>To provide the student leaders with sufficient training, activities and programme to develop them to be good leaders.</li>
<li>To improve the status of student leaders in the school by providing more recognition of student leaders among the student population.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SL FRAMEWORK</strong></p>
<p><img style="width: 75%;" src="/images/sl-framework.png">
</p><p>A framework, in the form of a concentric circle, provides the structure for leadership development. This framework assumes that every student has leadership potential, and opportunities and training in leadership will be provided for each Canberran. All the student leaders will be involved in leadership development activities which centre about the ethos of shared leadership and servant leadership. It also comprises of the leadership skills and attributes that they will develop gradually.</p>
<p>Right in the centre is the Beginning Leaders – this comprises the Secondary One students and PSLs who will embrace self-leadership skills. This will enable students to appreciate that integrity, personal responsibility and self-discipline are vital to becoming an effective leader. At this stage, they would learn to take up a supportive role to the school.</p>
<p>From the centre, the next circle is the Peer Leaders – this comprises the Secondary Two students and councillors. This segment focuses on peer leadership, whereby students understand the importance of teamwork and build up confidence to lead small teams. At Secondary Two, the student leaders would then challenge their potential to become a confident leader who can assist their team leaders in the planning and execution of events.</p>
<p>From this second circle, the next circle is the Promising Leaders – this comprises the Secondary Three students, Student Council Executive Committee members and the CCA leaders. This segment pivots about project leadership, where students build up resilience, task and people management skills to solve problems positively. At Secondary Three, the student leaders would then conquer their aspirations with all the knowledge and skills they have acquired over the years. They would lead their respective teams to contribute to the school.</p>
<p>From the third circle, the outermost circle is the Mentoring Leaders – this comprises the Secondary Four and Five students. This segment focuses on team development whereby students will be empowered with influencing and mentoring skills who would then lead the juniors to contribute to the school and community.</p>
