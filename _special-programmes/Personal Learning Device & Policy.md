<p>MOE has rolled out a Personal Learning Device (PLD) Initiative that requires every secondary student to have access to his/her own Personal Learning Device (PLD). The aims are to enhance teaching and learning, support development of self-directedness, collaborative skills and digital literacies.</p>
<p>With the implementation of the MOE Student Learning Space (SLS) for all schools, students can also use their PLDs to access rich resources that are available in the portal to support their own learning anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>The school's prescribed PLD is the iPad 10.2 (9th generation) that all Secondary 1 students should acquire as their PLD in 2023.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More details on procurement, funding and other administrative matters will be provided to the 2023 Secondary 1 parents in early January 2023.</p>
