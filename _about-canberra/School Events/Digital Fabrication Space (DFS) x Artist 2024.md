<p>In a collaboration to expose students to design thinking, digital fabrication
and art, our Secondary 2 &amp; 3 student-artists had their first meeting
with Fashion Designers and Artists at the Singapore Science Centre.</p>

<p>They had a engaging afternoon, interacting with experienced full-time
artists and DFS mentors. They discussed ideas and concepts about weaving
fashion with 4Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle and rethink) and turning items
into wearable art.</p>

<p>In the words of some of our students-artists:</p>
<p>YuXin (3 Empathy): I had fun, especially since we wer</p>
<p>e encouraged to think out of the box.</p>
<p>Maya (3 Integrity): I didn't realise that there are so many different
materials around us that we can actually use, using the 4Rs.</p>
<p>Richardo (3 Integrity): It was intitially tough to create ideas relating
to the theme of the clothing, but the mentors guided us on how to plan
and gave us some ideas!</p>
