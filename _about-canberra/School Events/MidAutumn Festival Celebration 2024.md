<p>On 16-17 September 2024, Canberra Secondary School buzzed with excitement
as we celebrated the Mid-Autumn Festival, showcasing Singapore's rich multicultural
tapestry. The festivities kicked off with the Principal's announcement
during assembly on 17 September, followed by a delightful mooncake distribution
to all students, ensuring everyone could savor various traditional flavors.</p>
<p>The Chinese and Malay language classes embarked on an immersive cultural
journey, featuring short video screenings, an engaging Kahoot quiz, and
challenging riddles. Cohort 1 and 2 students also participated in a traditional
lantern decoration activity, fostering cross-cultural understanding among
students of diverse backgrounds.</p>
