<h1><strong>Nurturing Bonds, Enlightening Minds: A Day of Family Wisdom and Cultural Delights</strong></h1>

Secondary School Parent Support Group (PSG) orchestrated a heartwarming
gathering at the school library. Seventeen families came together for a
day brimming with learning and celebration, the atmosphere inside warm
and inviting, filled with laughter and a spirit of togetherness.</p>

<p>Parents delved into an insightful "Parenting the Adolescents" workshop,
guided by experienced counsellors. They explored the intricacies of teenage
psychology, acquired effective communication strategies, and discovered
ways to positively engage with their growing children. Meanwhile, their
youngsters were engrossed in stimulating Scrabble games in another room
of the library, their minds alight with friendly competition.</p>
<p>As the workshop concluded, the aroma of spices and sweet treats filled
the air. Families came together for a delightful "Cultural Feast", celebrating
the Mid-Autumn Festival by crafting delicate snow skin mooncakes. The joyous
atmosphere continued as they learned the art of Indian curry cooking, the
rich flavors adding a special touch to their lunch.</p>
