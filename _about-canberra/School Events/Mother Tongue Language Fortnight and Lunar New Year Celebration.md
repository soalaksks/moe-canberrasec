<p>In January 2025, the Mother Tongue Department organized the Mother Tongue
Language Fortnight and Lunar New Year Celebration, giving our Canberrans
the chance to learn about Chinese culture in a fun and interactive way.</p>
<p>During Mother Tongue Language Fortnight, Canberrans explored cultural
booths where they tried calligraphy, fan painting, lantern making, and
Mandarin orange craft. They also played traditional games such as spinning
top, pitch-the-pot, pick-up sticks, and five stones. To bring festive cheer
to the school, students took part in the Classroom Decoration Competition,
using Lunar New Year ornaments and recycled materials to decorate their
classrooms. This year, their decorations were inspired by the zodiac animal—the
Snake.</p>
<p>The Lunar New Year Celebration was a lively and meaningful event. It started
with Lo Hei sessions (the traditional prosperity toss salad ritual), where
our Canberrans and their form teachers tossed the festive dish while exchanging
good wishes. They also took part in craft activities, such as clay modeling,
lantern painting, ink and wash painting, terracotta warrior making, and
traditional Chinese architecture crafting. They also had fun playing classic
traditional games like iron-hoop rolling and Chinese yoyo.</p>
<p>The celebration ended with exciting performances. Our talented Guzheng
Ensemble and Dance Club performed, followed by thrilling acts from external
performers, including the Festival Drums, an acrobatic show, a Lion Dance,
and a special appearance by the God of Fortune, who brought blessings and
joy to everyone.</p>
<p>Through these activities, our Canberrans not only learned more about Chinese
culture and traditions but also bonded with their friends and teachers.
The event encouraged them to appreciate diversity, express gratitude, and
celebrate the Lunar New Year in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>以蛇年为主题的新春课室布置比赛中，各班级尽显创意与巧思，呈现了别具一格的节日风采。1月28日除夕庆祝活动将活动推向高潮：班级Lohei笑声不断，礼堂里的现代舞、古筝演奏、舞狮、杂耍及节令鼓等表演轮番上演，精彩绝伦。校长致辞中特别感谢校工的辛勤付出，并代表学校赠送家长会制作的年饼，表达诚挚的感恩之情。</p>
