<p>On 17th May 2024, our school’s Parent Support Group (PSG) hosted a fantastic
BBQ session for the End-of-Semester 1 Celebration and Bonding Activity!
🎉
<br>
<br>The evening was filled with delicious food, great conversations, and meaningful
connections. It was truly heartwarming to see everyone come together to
celebrate and bond in such a relaxed and enjoyable setting.
<br>
<br>A big thank you to all the staff members who stayed back to attend the
event. Your presence and wonderful interaction with the parents were greatly
appreciated and played a vital role in strengthening our school community.
<br>
<br>We also extend our gratitude to our School Leaders for their unwavering
support and to our dedicated PSG leads, Ms Lim and Mdm Yong, for their
invaluable guidance in making this event a success.
<br>
<br>Thank you once again to everyone who contributed to making this event
a memorable one! 🌟</p>
