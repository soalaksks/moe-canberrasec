<h4>FINANCIAL MATTERS</h4>
<p><strong>Who is eligible for the Edusave Account?<br></strong>All Singaporean children who are enrolled in MOE-funded schools will be given an Edusave account and receive an annual Edusave contribution. For more details, please refer to MOE website: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/edusave-account" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/edusave-account</a></p>
<p><strong>Can I use the Edusave account money to pay for exam fees, uniforms and textbooks?<br></strong>No. Edusave accounts are a form of Government subsidy to Singaporean students at primary and secondary levels to meet their educational expenditure. If financial assistance is required for exam fees, uniforms and textbooks, you can approach the school to apply for financial assistance.</p>
<p><strong>How can I find out the balance in my child’s Edusave account?<br></strong>In February each year, MOE will send the annual Edusave statement directly to all account holders. It will list all transactions from February in the previous year to January in the current year, including interest credited.</p>
<p>Parents can check the available balance in their account and the amount and date of the last Edusave contribution through the Edusave Phone Enquiry System at telephone number 6260 0777.</p>
