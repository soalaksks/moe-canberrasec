<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p><strong>The National Police Cadet Corp (NPCC) aims to develop our cadets into disciplined, responsible and contributive members of the school and greater community.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The direction for NPCC in 2016 is to create a uniformed group that is more engaging and inclusive for all cadets and to provide more opportunities for our cadets to serve the community.</strong></p>
<p>This year, the unit collaborated with Sembawang Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) in the Citizens-On-Patrol Initiative. Our Secondary 2 and 3 cadets participated in joint-patrols with officers from the Sembawang NPC. The cadets also had the opportunity to participate in new courses such as Crime Scene Investigations and SG Secure Workshop.</p>
<p>We are proud to announce that our unit achieved the Silver Award for Unit Overall Proficiency Award (UOPA) 2015.</p>
