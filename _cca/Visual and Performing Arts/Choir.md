<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4><p>Canberra Secondary School Choir aims to enable students (ranging from no musical background to advanced musicians) to learn and apply knowledge and skills in Vocal and Choral techniques. Through the incorporation of personal and creative expression in individual, small group and large group performances, this would encourage students and build their self-confidence. We provide opportunities for the development of leadership potential in our members. The choir has also participated in VIA with All Saints’ Home (Yishun) to instill the values of Gratitude, Respect and Compassion in our students.</p><h4><strong>Highlights and Achievements</strong></h4><p>This year the Canberra School Choir is honored to perform and be a part of the school’s GRC Banquet which was held for the first time to launch the values -Grateful, Respectful &amp; Compassionate @Canberra Community and engage parents, partners and alumni as our very&nbsp;important partners (VIPs) in embracing GRC culture.</p><p>The Choir also served the elderly in All Saints’ Home (Yishun) through our involvement in the VIA where we prepared the elderly for a combined performance. The preparation for the performance&nbsp;encouraged the elderly to be more mobile through the use of music.</p><p>We also performed for the public on Wednesday, 08 August 2018 at the National Day Dinner Performance at Canberra Park.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Teachers-In-Charge</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mrs Hee-Lim</p><p>Mr Quek Yeow Chong</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Training Days / Time</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Wednesday 2.30 pm - 6 pm</p></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/choir.png"></div><p></p>
