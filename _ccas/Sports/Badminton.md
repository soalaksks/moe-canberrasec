<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4><p>The Badminton Team aims to inculcate values of respect, fair play and sportsmanship in our players and to enhance their resilience and tenacity so that these qualities will serve them well in future in all aspect of their lives. We also want our students to demonstrate the R3ICH (Resilience, Respect, Responsibility, Integrity, Care and Harmony) values, Olympic values (Friendship, Respect and&nbsp;Excellence) and discipline.</p><h4><strong>Highlights and Achievements</strong></h4><p>Our ‘C’ Division boys have done us proud by emerging fourth in the North Zone, thus qualifying for the 2018 NSG National ‘C’ Division Badminton (Boys) Championships. The ‘C’ Division girls reached the North Zone Quarter Finals ‘C’ Division (Girls) Competition. The Annual Training Camp and other intensive training programmes bore fruit. We look forward to achieving greater heights in the future.</p><p>The students also took part in several Values In Action activities, such as coaching clients from the Metta Home in Badminton regularly and tennis during the Tennis Fest at the Sports Hub in conjunction with Active SG and Team Nila, accompanying clients in games at the Zoo Zoom Day at the Singapore Zoo and taking part in a ground-breaking event at Canberra Stadium.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Teachers-In-Charge :</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Lok Chee How</p><p>Ms Joann David</p><p>Mr Ho Ngiap Tuan</p><p>Mrs Denise James</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Training Days / Time :</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Monday &amp; Wednesday: 2.30 pm - 5.30 pm</p></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/badminty.jpg"></div><p></p>
