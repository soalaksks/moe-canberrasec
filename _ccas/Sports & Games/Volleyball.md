<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>The Canberra Secondary School Volleyball team aims to give the players the opportunity to improve themselves through Volleyball. Canberra Volleyball CCA provides our players with a positive and enjoyable experience and teaches them team work and sportsmanship through competition. Through rigorous training, we also seek to instil the right attitude of discipline and resilience.</p>
<h4><strong>Highlights and Achievements</strong></h4>
<p>Our students have the opportunity to compete in various local competitions, including the National Schools Games, as well as the Volleyball Association of Singapore (VAS) Under 13 and Under 16 competitions. Training programmes are planned to meet the students’ needs and help them to improve in physical, cognitive and affective domains. The yearly programme also includes regular friendly games with partner schools as well as training camps to foster a strong team spirit.</p>
<p>“Attitude and Discipline” is the tagline for the team, with a strong emphasis on each student’s character. Emphasis is placed on this over talent, as we firmly believe that the right values will serve the students well in every aspect of their lives. Hence, our CCA programme includes regular Values in Action (VIA) activities that help to inculcate the school values of Gratitude, Respect and Compassion in our players. In 2018, we have partnered with ActiveSG, Canberra Community Club, as well as various other organisations to help the needy in the Canberra GRC as well as wider community.</p>
