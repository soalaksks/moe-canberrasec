<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>The Taekwondo Club aims to inculcate the values of discipline and self-control
in our students, extending beyond physical benefits to mental and emotional
development. Through regular training, competitions, and team-building
activities, we teach valuable life skills, promote physical fitness, and
foster a sense of community. This club plays a vital role in shaping well-rounded,
confident individuals ready to face life's challenges.</p>
<h4><strong>Highlights and Achievements</strong></h4>
<p>Our Taekwondo training sessions are designed to improve students' physical,
mental, and emotional capabilities, preparing them for competitions in
the National Schools Games (NSG). Members participate in bi-annual grading
sessions and have the opportunity to compete at the NSG level, showcasing
their skills and applying their learning. These experiences foster both
independent work and teamwork.</p>
<p>Beyond technical skills, our program incorporates Values-in-Action (VIA)
activities, which help instill our school values of Gratitude, Respect,
and Compassion in our student athletes. This holistic approach ensures
that participants grow not only as athletes but also as well-rounded individuals.</p>
