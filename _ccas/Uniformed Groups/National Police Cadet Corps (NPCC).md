<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4><p><strong>The National Police Cadet Corp (NPCC) aims to develop our cadets into disciplined, responsible and contributive members of the school and greater community.</strong></p><p><strong>The direction for NPCC in 2016 is to create a uniformed group that is more engaging and inclusive for all cadets and to provide more opportunities for our cadets to serve the community.</strong></p><p>This year, the unit collaborated with Sembawang Neighbourhood Police Centre (NPC) in the Citizens-On-Patrol Initiative. Our Secondary 2 and 3 cadets participated in joint-patrols with officers from the Sembawang NPC. The cadets also had the opportunity to participate in new courses such as Crime Scene Investigations and SG Secure Workshop.</p><p>We are proud to announce that our unit achieved the Silver Award for Unit Overall Proficiency Award (UOPA) 2015.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Teachers-In-Charge :</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mr Imarah Abas</p><p>Mr Jeremiah Tan</p><p>Mr Shaik Allauddin</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Training Day / Time :</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Wednesday 2.30 pm - 6 pm</p></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/npcc.jpg"></div><p></p>
