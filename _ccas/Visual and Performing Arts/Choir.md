<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Our choir enables students, from beginners to advanced musicians, to learn
and apply vocal and choral techniques. Through personal and creative expression
in individual, small group, and large group performances, we build students'
self-confidence and leadership potential. By participating in Values in
Action (VIA) activities with Canberra Elderly RN Zone 3, we instill the
values of Gratitude, Respect, and Compassion in our students. We are committed
to fostering a supportive and enriching environment where every member
can grow musically and personally, contributing positively to the community.</p>
<h4><strong>Highlights and Achievements</strong></h4>
<p>The choir's participation in Canberra Day on 10 March 2024 presented a
vibrant opportunity to engage with the community through music and celebration
with the Sound of Music Medley. By performing at this significant event,
the choir not only showcased their musical talents but also fostered a
deeper connection with residents. This engagement allowed the choir to
contribute to the festive atmosphere of Canberra Day, strengthening community
ties and enhancing the cultural fabric of the celebration. The experience
was both rewarding for the choir members and enriching for the community,
as it highlighted the power of music in bringing people together and celebrating
shared values.</p>

<p>The Catholic High School Choir's Limelight Concert, held on 11 March 2024
at the Esplanade Concert Hall, provided students with a significant opportunity
for growth and development. The event exposed students to a prestigious
performance environment, allowing them to experience the dynamics of a
major concert venue. Performing at such a distinguished location enhanced
their technical skills and stage presence, while offering valuable insights
into the professional music world. The exposure inspired students, boosted
their confidence, and contributed substantially to their artistic and personal
growth.</p>
