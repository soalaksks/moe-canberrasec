<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>The main objectives of the school’s Concert Band are to provide members
with the skills to perform for various occasions and build their self-confidence.
Also, we want to create opportunities to develop and enhance the leadership
potential of our members.</p>
<h4><strong>Highlights and Achievements</strong></h4>
<p>Under the baton of Mr Xaven Chng, the Canberra Secondary School Concert
Band participated in the Singapore Youth Festival Art Presentation 2023
and achieved a Certificate of Commendation. The pieces played were <em>Tanah di Bawah Angin</em> and <em>Terracotta Warriors</em>.
Through this SYF experience, the band realized that every practice must
be taken seriously in order for us to accomplish greater heights in the
future. As a result, we learned to be more tenacious and rigorous in our
practices through these performances and the process of going through several
practices.&nbsp; Through conversations about how to execute our SYF compositions,
the band also developed its ability to function effectively as a team.</p>

<p>We also offer Junior Band Training Programme for all new Secondary 1 recruits.
Our Junior Band conductor, Mr. Bernard Ong, trains all new members, even
if they do not have any musical background. Additionally, the band seniors
also take on the responsibility of training the Secondary Ones. Such experiences
allows our senior members to build up their level of confidence and proficiency,
while providing guidance to the new members.</p>
