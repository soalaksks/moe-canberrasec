<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>The Canberra Secondary School Guzheng Ensemble is a long-term CCA Performing
Arts Group that encourages its members to experience and develop an interest
in music-making and appreciation. Our ensemble equips members with skills
and techniques to perform in various competitions, school events, and community
gatherings.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on being a multi-racial and multi-national group, welcoming
members of different races and nationalities who are interested in performing
Chinese musical instruments.</p>
<p>Our main focus this year is to prepare and groom our members for the Singapore
Youth Festival Arts Presentation in 2025. Through intense training sessions,
our members have forged stronger bonds as they work towards this common
goal.</p>
<p>In 2024, we have participated in several community events as part of our
Values-In-Action projects. In February 2024, our members performed at the
Canberra Zone 2 Residents' Network Chinese New Year Lo-Hei Celebration.
Based on our longstanding participation in the Singapore Youth Festival
Guzheng Competition, we were specifically invited to perform for the Guest-of-Honour,
Dr Lim Wee Kiak, Member of Parliament for Sembawang GRC.</p>
